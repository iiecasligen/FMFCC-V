## FMFCC-V
A Large-Scale Challenging Asian Facial Dataset for DeepFake Forensics

### FMFCC-V Dataset

The FMFCC-V dataset is by far the largest publicly available Asian facial dataset for DeepFake forensics. There are in total 38102 DeepFake videos and 44290 pristine videos, corresponding more than 12 million frames, in the FMFCC-V dataset. The source videos are collected from 83 paid individuals speaking in a variety of conditions for roughly 40 minutes each. All individuals are Asian and give consents to the use and manipulation of their faces by signing a formal agreement. The DeepFake videos are generated using four kinds of most popular face swapping methods for roughly 16 minutes each before post processing. In addition, we introduced diversity into both DeepFake videos and pristine videos through deliberate addition of ten kinds of perturbations, simulating real world scenarios. Based on the FMFCC-V dataset and other existing datasets, we benchmark results of current representative DeepFake detection methods. The complete FMFCC-V dataset and the detailed analysis will be presented in a paper. A part of FMFCC-V dataset used in the FMFCC-V competition can be downloaded from BaiduCloud (Website: https://pan.baidu.com/s/10YEfu2nMe2obiIXeUM5T9g Password: 2021).

### FMFCC-V Competition

Based on the FMFCC-V dataset, we have successfuly hosted a benchmark competition, Video track of the first Fake Media Forensic Challenge of China Society of Image and Graphics (FMFCC-V). The FMFCC-V competition attracted over 400 contestants come from 60 different organizations. The monetary prizes provided a large incentive for these contestants to dedicate a lot of time and computational resources to optimize DeepFake detection algorithms for benchmarking. Compared with the DFDC competition organized by FaceBook, we only gather the predictions of test data rather than the source codes and models for protecting the intellectual property rights of contestants. Based on the results of the FMFCC-V competition, we provided a detailed analysis of top-performing submissions. The details will be presented in a paper.
